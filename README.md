# <b><font>Self-driving car with JavaScript and Neural Network</font></b>

<p>
<font size = 4>This project implements a simulated self-driving car in JavaScript that utilizes a
  
neural network for decision-making. It's designed to be a learning experience in

both neural networks and self-driving car concepts.</font>

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BogdanBargaoanu/JavaScriptSelfDrivingCar.git
```
2. Open the index file.

# How it Works
1. The car receives sensor data about its surroundings.
2. The sensor data is fed into the neural network.
3. The neural network processes the data and outputs steering and acceleration values.
4. Based on the output values, the car adjusts its steering and speed.
5. The car that travels the furthest without crashing is focused, and its brain can be saved or discarded for use in next generations.
